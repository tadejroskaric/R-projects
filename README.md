# R-projects

The projects in this repository were made during my Applied Statistics studies at the University of Ljubljana.

1. sem1_Roškarič.Rmd. This one was an assignment were we needed to estimate the value of the number pi using Monte Carlo integration. I uploaded the R markdown file with the code and added text explanations (latter being in Slovenian). The generated PDF file is also available. 

2. vrata.R. One day me and a friend were debating the Monty Hall problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem for further reference). He argued that the player should change doors. I was not convinced so I created a simulation in this file. Turns out he was right :).
