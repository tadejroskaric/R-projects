# R-projects

The projects in this repository were made during my Applied Statistics studies at the University of Ljubljana.

1. sem1_Roškarič. This one was an assignment were we needed to estimate the value of the number pi using Monte Carlo integration. I uploaded the R markdown file with the code and added text explanations (latter being in Slovenian). The generated PDF file is also available.
